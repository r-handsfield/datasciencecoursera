Question 1
Suppose I conduct a study and publish my findings. Which of the following is an example of a replication of my study?

CORRECT ANSWER
An investigator at another institution conducts a study addressing the same question,
collects her own data, analyzes it separately from me, and publishes her own findings.


Question 2
Which of the following is a requirement for a published data analysis to be reproducible?

1) Data/metadata used  to  develop  test  should  be  made  publicly  available
2) The computer code and fully specified computational procedures used for development
of the candidate omics???based test should be made sustainably available
3)Ideally, the computer code that is released will encompass all of the steps of
computational analysis including all data preprocessing steps, that have been
described in this chapter. All aspects of the analysis need to be transparently reported.

CORRECT ANSWER
The full computer code for doing the data analysis is made publicly available.


Question 3
Which of the following is an example of a reproducible study?

CORRECT ANSWER
B) The studys analytic data and computer code for the data analysis are publicly available.


Question 4
Which of the following is a reason that a study might NOT be fully replicated?
1) No time/ money
2) Take advantage of a unique situatiuon
3) Study takes too long, ex. a 20 year longitudinal study

CORRECT ANSWER
The original study was very expensive and there is no money to repeat it in a different setting.


Question 5
Which of the following is a reason why publishing reproducible research is increasingly important?

CORRECT ANSWER
New technologies are increasing the rate of data collection, creating datasets that are more
complex and extremely high dimensional.


Question 6
What is the role of processing code in the research pipeline?

CORRECT ANSWER
It transforms the measured data into analytic data.


Question 7
Which is a goal of literate statistical programming?

CORRECT ANSWER
Combine explanatory text and data analysis code in a single document.


Question 8
What does it mean to weave a literate statistical program?

CORRECT ANSWER
Transform the literate program into a human readable document.

Question 9
Which of the following is required to implement a literate programming system?

1. A  documentation  language  (human  readable)
2. A  programming  language  (machine  readable

CORRECT ANSWER
A documentation language like LaTeX.


Question 10
What is one way in which the knitr system differs from Sweave?

1)Brings together many features added on to Sweave to address limitations
2) knitr uses R as the programming language (although others are allowed)
and variety of documenta5on languages LaTeX, Markdown, HTML
3) knitr was developed by Yihui Xie

CORRECT ANSWER
knitr allows for the use of markdown instead of LaTeX
