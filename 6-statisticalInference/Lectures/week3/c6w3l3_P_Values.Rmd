# 10 P-Values

The P-value is the probability of getting data more extreme (more outliers) than the observed data in favor of the alternative. The probability calculation assumes the _null_ is true. 

If we get a large T-Statistic, then the P-Value answers the question "If the null is actually true, then how likely is it to get a larger T-Statistic than the one we have?" A small P-value means that our current T-Stat is one of the most possibly extreme, we're unlikely to see a larger one, and the _null_ is probably false.

P-values are a convenient way to communicate the results of a hypothsis test. When communicating a P-value, the reader can perform the test at whatever Type 1 error rate they want. 

1. Compare the P-Value to the desred Type 1 error rate 
2. If the P-value is smaller, reject the null hypothesis.
